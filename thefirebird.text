The Firebird used to live in a wet forest with their community. One day, without previous notice, their house is put on fire by someone who couldnâ€™t understand the way they were living. And so the Firebird flies away from home. 
The Fire Bird migrates to the city, in the north, alone, and finds a place to sleep where no human could find them. The thing is that they were carrying an invisible fire seed inside their belly. 
So in the place where they sleep, they dream for so long, that the invisible seed that was inside of their belly finds time to germinate and turns into a tree.
